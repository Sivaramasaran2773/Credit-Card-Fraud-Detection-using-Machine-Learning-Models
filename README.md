# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-Models
This repository focuses on Credit Card Fraud Detection using ML models such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) built from scratch, without utilizing any pre-built commands.


## Methods Used:
* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN)
* Support Vector Machine(SVM)

## About the Dataset:

The dataset used in this repository is sourced from Kaggle, and it can be found at the following link: 

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud. 

*For the purpose of reducing the run time of the machine learning models implemented from scratch (without using pre-built commands), an additional dataset has been extracted from the original dataset. This supplementary dataset is comparatively smaller, allowing for faster execution of the custom-built models. By employing this optimized dataset, the aim is to streamline the development and testing process of the ML algorithms for credit card fraud detection while still achieving accurate and reliable results.*

* Original Dataset - creditcard.csv
* Modified Dataset - creditcard3.csv
